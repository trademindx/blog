## Get the edge in cryptocurrency trading!

Trademindx aims to facilitate daily trading decisions through applied natural-language processing, sentiment analysis and machine learning algorithms.

Built as a micro-services based distributed architecture, its primarily function is to analyse large volumes of data and provide clear trading indicators to the client in real-time.

Simply put, Trademindx crunches huge amounts of data and tells you which cryptocurrencies to invest in for maximum returns.
The system combines natural-language processing, sentiment analysis and machine learning algorithms to classify large volumes of data into clear (buy, sell or hold) trading signals in real-time.

The default approach is implemented using a maximum entropy algorithm with feedback, which applies a multinomial logistic regression model to categorise data and continually improve accuracy.

It is currently being developed specifically for cryptocurrency applications starting with Bitcoin (BTC) and all other altcoins with a large market capitalisation (more that $100mm).
