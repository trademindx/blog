## How to Buy TMX Tokens

If you want to buy TMX tokens to gain access to the Trademindx machine learning platform once it is up-and-running, you have come to the right place.

This is the official guide! So let’s get started!

Note: this guide is also useful if you have never purchased any ERC20 Ethereum based tokens such as BAT, POE, TRX or REQ to name a few.

## Get an Ethereum Wallet

The first thing you will need is an Ethereum wallet that is pre-funded with the amount of Ether (ETH) you want to exchange for TMX.

Your wallet must be compatible with ERC20 tokens, such as MyEtherWallet. If you do not have a MyEtherWallet or other token compatible wallet, then head over to [MyEtherWallet][mew] and set one up!

Exchange based wallets are usually not compatible with tokens and should not be used. Moreover they are not a safe place to store your Ether (or other coins/tokens) — see side note below!

For a list of wallets that are compatible, please consult this guide.

## Pre-fund Your Ethereum Wallet

Next you will need some Ether in your wallet, so you can exchange it for TMX tokens! For this, you will need to buy some Ether.

You can use a service such as Coinbase for this. Register for an account with [Coinbase][coinbase] and then purchase some Ether. This will place the Ether in your Coinbase wallet.

For a guide on how to buy Ether through Coinbase, please [read this guide][eth]. Once you have purchased some Ether send it from Coinbase to your MyEtherWallet wallet above.

Great, you are almost good to go!

Side note: In general, it is advisable not to hold Ether in wallets or any other tokens provided by Coinbase or exchanges as they are more likely to get hacked. Always store your Ether in a wallet such as MyEtherWallet or even invest in an offline hardware wallet like the Ledger. Your wallet will usually come with 2 keys, a public key and a private key. Your public key, is well… public, it is also referred to as your public address, so it is safe to share. Never share your private key with anyone!

## Get Familiar With Trademindx!
